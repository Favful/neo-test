Finally after doing a bunch of reviews, I redeemed it right here on Favful. When it\\n    arrived I was so eager to try it out. First of all, the product comes in a plastic 100ml tub and a little spatula to\\n    scoop the product. The product itself reminds me of scented candles. It a light pink colour, looks waxy, and has a\\n    light fruity scent, I would say i smells like Ikea&apos;s vanilla scented candles. Upon skin contact it turns into a\\n    oil. So I tested a bunch of lip tints, lipsticks, waterproof eyeliner, waterproof mascara and lots of eyeshadow on\\n    the back of my hand. After scooping a small amount of the product, I rub it so the product turns into oil and slowly\\n    melt away the makeup. It turns the oil into whatever colour the makeup is, so mine turned red from the lipsticks. I\\n    was worried it will stain my hand but thankfully it didn&apos;t. It managed to clean all the makeup easily after a\\n    few rubs. As for the waterproof  eyeliner and mascara, it needed more rubbing to cleanly remove all if it. Alot of\\n    my eyeshadow have glitter and shimmer in it. I tried just using a tissue to wipe away the residue and oil. It wiped\\n    away easily and rather clean but leaves behind some glitter and shimmer. Surprisingly my Aritaum Color Lasting lip\\n    tint left a stain after rubbing with this product. I usually don&apos;t consider the Aritaum lip tint to be very\\n    long lasting. However, after using a foam cleanser to wash, all the glitter and lip tint stain came right off. So\\n    yes, it does a great job removing makeup like it says it does. The balm to oil formula is easy to work with and\\n    doesn&apos;t leave a mess like cleansing oil.</p>","createdAt":"2016-10-19 17:47:52.911391","updatedAt":"2016-10-24 11:42:43.614493","rating":{"id":"16971","rater_id":"3009","rateable_id":"18932","rateable_type":"Product","stars":"5","dimension":"name","created_at":"2016-10-19 17:47:52.936588","updated_at":"2016-10-19 17:47:52.936588"},"media":[],"visible":true},{"id":"21213","user":{"id":"10823","avatar":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/users/avatars/000/010/823/original/picture","email":"elizabethfongkaili@gmail.com","createdAt":"2016-10-31 01:36:49.006514","updatedAt":"2018-10-18 00:14:51.806147","username":"Elizabeth","skinType":"normal","skinColor":"fair","ageGroup":"18_25"},"title":"♡clean it zero","comment":"<p>Super easy to use and all the makeup comes off in one wash.

The scent is mild and\\n    pleasantly and i like the texture which is more to ointment type. Guess what? you don&apos;t need to using cotton\\n    pad when removing make up. Just massage on your face and it will turn to oil. Convenience and clean removing effect,\\n    it will bring out all the make up when you wash your face. Have repurchase twice and i found out they is no any make\\n    up remover can replace it.

Banila Co&apos;s Clean it Zero is definitely taking the K-beauty\\n    world by storm and dupes which work probably even better for a similar price have been made.\\n<p>Coming in a pink box with a pastel pink container and a bright pink lid, the Banila Co Clean it Zero also comes with\\n    a spatula for you to scoop up the product for not only hygiene purposes, but also because of the fact that the\\n    product turns to liquid (oil) upon contact with the skin. Because of this, I would say a little goes a long way and\\n    there is a tendency to scoop up too much product. Not to worry though as through time you&apos;ll definitely be able\\n    to gauge how much you&apos;ll definitely need. Usage is to apply onto the face, massage the face and spend more time\\n    on places with waterproof makeup, wet hands and massage again to emulsify the product and then rise off. I usually\\n    double cleanse so I follow it with a foaming cleanser.</p>\\n<p>As for removing waterproof makeup, this remover does a fairly decent job. On my hand there was waterproof liquid\\n    liner (dolly wink -Black, K-palette - Brown), lip tints (Etude house cherry tint - pink, Peripera ink - orange) and\\n    gel pencil liners (Innisfree gel liner - black and brown). The dolly wink needed some massaging to get rid off while\\n    the others came off fairly easily except for the peri pera tint, which you can see is still slightly there even\\n    after adding water to emulsify it and rinsing it.</p>\\n<p>Another note that it has a scent to it so if you&apos;re not a fan of strong scents, this might be strong for some.\\n    In fact, after only rinsing with water, the scent still lingers. It also clouds the eyes when massaging away the\\n    waterproof eyeliner in the eyes and some people do not like that feeling. Though if it happens, rinse your eyes with\\n    water and dry it. Luckily enough, it did not sting my eyes while it clouded it.</p>\\n<p>Overall I would say this is a fairly good product and lasts a very long time. However, I find that there are other\\n    products with a similar price tag that does a better job as this product tends to also leave a sort of film on the\\n    skin after washing it off which makes me wonder if it did wash my foundation off well enough. I find that I like to\\n    bring this for travels (since it&apos;s not liquid) but I tend to strive towards my other makeup removers at\\n    home.</p>","createdAt":"2017-02-26 08:21:10.450643","updatedAt":"2017-03-02 08:37:34.465809","rating":{"id":"34222","rater_id":"11124","rateable_id":"18932","rateable_type":"Product","stars":"4.40451019793803","dimension":"name","created_at":"2017-02-26 08:21:13.560947","updated_at":"2017-02-26 08:21:13.560947"},"media":[{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/269/original/DSC06842.JPG"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/270/original/DSC06843.JPG"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/271/original/DSC06844.JPG"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/272/original/DSC06845.JPG"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/273/original/DSC06846.JPG"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/274/original/DSC06849.JPG"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/275/original/DSC06850.JPG"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/001/276/original/DSC06851.JPG"}],"visible":true},{"id":"39105","user":{"id":"11687","avatar":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/users/avatars/000/011/687/original/picture","email":"farahdzulhaimy@gmail.com","createdAt":"2016-11-29 12:26:17.629889","updatedAt":"2018-03-28 08:34:13.652939","username":"Farah Dzul","skinType":"combination","skinColor":"medium_fair","ageGroup":""},"title":"Balmy and works wonder","comment":"<p>I usually use this banila.co balm to remove my make up for the double cleansing ritual. the form is balmy. but when\\n    we rub it with palm and face, oil turns to oily form.  almost smells nothing (like a natural scent lip chap\\n    balm).</p>\\n<p>it does wonder upon taking off the make up. especially during emulsifying it with water and even cleaner after water\\n    cleansers.</p>\\n<p>it&apos;s significantly clean as oil formula cleanser as well as micellar water.</p>\\n<p>i totally in love with it!!</p>","createdAt":"2018-09-20 07:42:51.167209","updatedAt":"2018-09-21 04:02:51.545419","rating":{"id":"45950","rater_id":"11687","rateable_id":"18932","rateable_type":"Product","stars":"4.37309774180685","dimension":"name","created_at":"2018-09-20 07:42:53.552137","updated_at":"2018-09-20 07:42:53.552137"},"media":[{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/002/674/original/banila-co-clean-it-zero-sherbet-cleanser-original-01.jpg"},{"type":"image","url":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/review_images/avatars/000/002/675/original/WhatsApp_Image_2018-08-27_at_10.14.48.jpeg"}],"visible":false},{"id":"33801","user":{"id":"16902","avatar":"https://d1acy2vp0zxghs.cloudfront.net/users/avatars/000/016/902/original/36726916_10216114243589485_5450002525811900416_n.jpg","email":"evelyntiongmeiling@gmail.com","createdAt":"2017-04-01 07:15:45.450171","updatedAt":"2019-09-19 03:14:04.810977","username":"evelyntml","skinType":"combination","skinColor":"medium_fair","ageGroup":""},"title":"Impressed!","comment":"<p>Bought this after hearing a lot of good things about from my friends.
