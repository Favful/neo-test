Eight of the\\n    12 shadows have punny names based on rock bands. The other 4 shades are named after musical tempos. There is also a\\n    blush (a pale peachy pink) and a highlighter (SUPER luminous beigey gold) and two lip colors that can also double as\\n    cheek colors (a cherry red and an almost nude pale pink). The kit also includes a heart-shaped mirror. I have seen a\\n    lot of bulky makeup palettes, but this one is super compact and I could definitely see travelling with it. The\\n    palette is magnetized at top and bottom so it securely closes and even has an outer sleeve you could use if you were\\n    travelling, to make sure everything stays put in transit.
